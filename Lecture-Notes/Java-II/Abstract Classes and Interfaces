    - Interfaces vs Abstract Classes


Abstract Classes:
    - A class that can serve as a superclass, but can not directly instantiated.
    - You can define a class by using the abstract' keyword in the class definition.
    - A Abstract class can define abstract methods
        - Methods with no body
    - Abstract methods:
        - Only provide information about the method name, return type and parameter.

    - A class that inherits from an abstract class must define all abstract methods, or itself be abstract
