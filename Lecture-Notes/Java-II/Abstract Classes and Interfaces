    - Working with Abstract Classes
    - INterfaces
        - Working with Interfaces
    - Interfaces vs Abstract Classes


Abstract Classes:
    - Like a blue print for other classes.
    - Thin of it like a superhero custome design,
    - The word 'abstract' in programming means something that is not complete or concrete.
    - So an abstract class is like a half-way finished class,
    - A class that can serve as a super class, but can not directly be instantiated,

    - You can define an abstract class by using the keyword 'abstract' in the calss definition

    - Inside an abstract class, we can have abstract methods.
    - Which are abstracts without a body.
        - Think of it like recipe title without the cooking steps.
    We only know the name, what they return, and what they need to work.
    - When you extend it to another class, you have to create the body of the method in the subclass.

    - A class that inherits from an abstract class must define all abstract methods, or itself be abstract

    _Why do we use Abstact Classes?
