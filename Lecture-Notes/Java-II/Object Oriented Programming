Object Oriented Programming

* In this lecture we will learn to create and use:
    - Objects
    - Static
    - Instance fields
    - Constructors
    - Visibility

* We been using Objects-Oriented concepts, such as 'Math' that contains static methods and fields and the 'Scanner' class,
which we have created instances of to get command line input from the user.
*

Today's Agenda:
    - Classes and Objects
    - Static vs Instance
    - Constructors
    - The 'This' Keyword
    - Visibility



Classes and Objects
    - CLASSES:
        - Used to define a custom type of Java
        - Think of a class as a blueprint for objects.
    - FIELD:
        - A variable or method that belongs to an object or a class
        - Can be accessed with the "." operator
        - Fields belongs to objects, but can be defined as belonging to a class with the static keyword.
        - Fields are either properties (Variables) or Methods (Functions)
    - OBJECTS:
        - an instance of a class
        - Objects have fields and methods, and are instantiated.
        - Created with a 'new' keyword

    EXAMPLE:

        - Create a Person class in my src.
