Boolean Expressions
    - An expression that evaluates to a boolean value
    - Either true or false
    - There is 6 relational operators, returning a boolean value
            ==  Equality
            !=  Inequality
            >   Greater Than
            <   Less Than
            >=  Greater Than or Equal
            <=  Less Than or Equal
    - Unlike Javascript, Java has no concept of truthy or falsy, the expressions must evaluate to boolean values

Logical Operators
    - Allow us to combine multiple boolean values to produce a single boolean value.
