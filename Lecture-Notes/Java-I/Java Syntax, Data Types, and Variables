JavaSyntax, Data Types, and Variables


Today's Agenda:
    - Statements
    - Comments
    - Data Types
    - Strings
    - Variables
    - Identifiers and Keywords
    - Constants
    - Arithmetic Expressions
    - Arithmetic and Assignment Operators
    - Casting


Statement:
    - An executable instruction that tells the compiler what to perform
    - A statement is roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages
    - A statement may tell you to add values of x and y and assign their sum to the variable z

    - All statements must end with a semicolon
        - unlike Javascript, your Java code will not compile unless every statement ends with a semicolon
    - Statements can be grouped as a block inside of a curly braces {}
        - Code inside of {} must be indented

    - A Java statement can be classified into three categories.
        - Declaration Statement
            - This statement is used to declare variables
        - Expression Statement
            - This statement ends with a semicolon
        - Control Flow Statement
            - A statement that has a condition or loops a number of times

Comments:
    - Provide you additional information and documentation about code.
    - Comments are written for other programmers who may need to maintain a codebase, including your future self.

   - Luckily Java has the same comments as Javascript
        // Single Line Comment

        /**
        *   Multi-Line
        *   Comments
        *
        */

Data Types:
    There is two main categories of types in Java:
        - primitive
        - reference
    - Primitive Types:
        - The building blocks of the language;
        - any variable that holds a primitive type has a value
        - The 8 primitive data types in Java:
            1. byte - 1 Byte - very short integers from -128 to 127
            2. short - 2 Byte - short integers from -32,768 to 32,767
            3. int - 4 Byte - Integers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
            4. long - 8 Byte - Long integers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
            5. float - 4 Byte - Single-precision
            6. double - 8 Byte - Double-precision
            7. char - 2 Byte - Single Character
            8. Boolean - 1 Byte - True or False value
        - FOR NUMERIC TYPES, you can assign a value or lesser precision to a type of greater precision, but not the other way around.

    - Reference Types:
        - Refers to objects or Arrays
        - Default to a special value, null
        - Discuss more when we get to passing values into methods and objects.

Strings:
    - Unlike Javascript, there is a difference in single and double quotes.
    - Single Quotations are for single characters
    - Double Quotations are for strings.
    Ex:
        Correct:
            "This is a string"
            'D'
        DO NOT DO THIS:
            'This is a bad things'

    - When you use special characters in your string, it must be escaped (with a backlash \)
        " \" "  ->  "
        "\\"    ->  \
        "\n"    ->  New Line Character
        "\t"    ->  New Tab Character

    - We will dive deeper in strings in a later chapter
