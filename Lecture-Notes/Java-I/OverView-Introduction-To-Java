What is Java:
    - Java is an object oriented language,
        ? What does that mean?

    - The Original Name was Oak
        - Based on the Oak tree that was outside the windows of the devs office

    - But due to copyright issues it was changed to 'Java'
        - All because the amount of coffee the developers were drinking
    - Which created a tagline: "Write Once, Run Everywhere"

    - By 1998 Java SE (Standard Edition) & Java EE (Enterprise Edition)
