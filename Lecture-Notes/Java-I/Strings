String Definition:
    - A string is letters, numbers, and special characters strung together.
    - String are objects, not primitives.
    - This means that string variables are reference type, not primitive type, and that is why '==' operator does not behave as expected when comparing strings.
    - even though they had the same value, they were two distinct objects
        - one was created from a string literal
        - the other was created by the scanner reading what the user typed into
