            Contact Application:

                applciation should:
                    [] Show all contacts
                    [ ] Add new Contacts
                    [ ] Search a contact by their name
                    [ ] Delete an existing contact

                    [ ]  keep its data in a file named contacts.txt

                Keep in Mind:
                    [ ] The text file should contain one contact per line.
                    [ ] When the application starts, the contact list should be read from the file
                    [ ] Before the application exits, the contacts file should be rewritten.
                    [X] The user interface for your application should include a main menu like the following, where the user will need to enter a number between 1 and 5:
                            1. View contacts.
                            2. Add a new contact.
                            3. Search a contact by name.
                            4. Delete an existing contact.
                            5. Exit.
                            Enter an option (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5):

                    [ ] The contacts information should be shown using the following format
                            Name | Phone number
                            ---------------
                            Jack Blank | 1231231234
                            Jane Doe | 2342342345
                            Sam Space | 3453453456

                Here is what the code for your application might look like:

                    [ ] Load all of the contacts by calling a method that returns a List of Contact objects.
                    [ ] Call a method that shows the user the main menu and returns their choice of action.
                    [ ] Using the user's choice from the previous step, call a method that performs that action (modifying the contents of the List of Contact objects if applicable).
                    [ ] Keep calling the method from step two until the user chooses to exit.
                    [ ] Once the user chooses to exit, re-write the contents of the contacts.txt file using the List of Contact objects.
