        //Exceptions, we can work with - we can look at checking for them (while compiling) or attempt to provide structures to find them







//        Example:

        int[] nums = {1,2,3};
        System.out.println(nums[999]);


        //you can tell Java to THROW an exception

        System.out.println("I did hydrate - with Coffee");
        throw new Exception("Fenrir Hydration Exception - did you hydrate?");


//        try {
//
//        }catch ();
